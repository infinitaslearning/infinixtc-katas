# InfiniXTC Katas

Katas we've been working on during the InfiniXTC meetups.

## How to get set up

### TypeScript

`cd` into `infinixtc-katas/TypeScript` and run

`npm i`

Run the tests with

`npm t`

### Other languages

For katas in other languages, create a top level directory with the language name and include the setup and installation inside that directory.
